******************************************Sentiment-Analysis*****************************************************************************
The aim of this project is to analyses the sentiment of social media twitter data which help to improve the user experience over a social network or system interface. The learning algorithm will learn what are the emotions of the news data present in social media. Using sentiment analysis, we aim to provide excellent performance for real time news data on social media and also provide better results in terms of accuracy.

*******************************************Objectives:*********************************************************************************

  To implement an algorithm for automatic classification of text into positive, negative or neutral.
 
  Classification single sentence or topic wise data extracted from twitter on the basis of polarity (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
 
  Sentiment Analysis algorithm (Naïve Bayes) to determine the attitude of the mass is positive, negative or neutral towards the subject of interest.
 
  Graphical representation of the sentiment in form of Pie-Chart.
 
 

******************************************The problem at hand consists of two subtasks*****************************************************

  Sentiment Analysis in Twitter:
 
  Given a message containing a marked instance of a word or a phrase, determine whether that instance is positive, negative or neutral in that context.
 
  Sentence Level Sentiment Analysis :
 
  Given a message, decide whether the message is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. For messages conveying both a positive and negative sentiment, whichever is the          stronger sentiment should be chosen.
 
 
 
***************************************Software Development Paradigm:***************************************************************************

 Data Gathering: Gathering the data from social media i.e. from Twitter.

 Text Cleaning & Pre-processing: Analysing the data i.e. checking the grammar, inconsistency, stop words and dividing the data into training set and testing set.

 Build, Train & Evaluate the Model: Building the training model (algorithm), training the data set over it and evaluating how the model is working.

 Sentiment Classification: Classifying the sentiments of the training data set and to check how much accuracy the model is providing.

 Deploy the Model for Output: Deploying the model for testing the data set with accurate output
